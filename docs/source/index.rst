The General Purpose Raytracing Toolkit
======================================

Welcome to the manual for GPRT, the general purpose raytracing toolkit.

Our goal is to make high performance GPU ray tracing hardware more accessible to 
a broader developer audience, whether that be on NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel ARC. 
With this toolkit, we help make your ray tracing development fast and easy 
by providing GPU-parallel acceleration structures, shader binding table 
management, and RT pipeline creation. We also provide a collection of examples 
*here* that should help you get started on all your ray tracing expeditions!
